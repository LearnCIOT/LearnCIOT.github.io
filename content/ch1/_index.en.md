# 1. Introduction

{{< toc >}}

## Environment Perception

Human beings are full of curiosity about the changes in the natural world, which can probably trace back to the activities of ancient agricultural civilizations, looking up at the stars and stargazing at night. By the Renaissance in the 16th century AD, Copernicus deduced the "heliocentric theory" based on the existing astronomical data. After Galileo and Newton, it became the origin of modern science. Since modern times, due to the rapid development of semiconductor manufacturing technology, the tools that people use to perceive changes in the living environment have become more and more diverse, sophisticated and miniaturized. In order to catch up with the ever-changing trends of information technology, combined with the real-time perception of sensors and the connection of the Internet, data transmission is getting faster and more popular, and a large amount of observation data is generated, transmitted and archived. In response to massive data, scientists have been working hard to find the laws of environmental changes, explore the relationship between these laws and disasters, and obtain prediction results to improve people's quality of life, thereby improving the efficiency of disaster prevention and relief, and promoting a more friendly relationship between people and the environment. The goal of creating a beautiful and sustainable living environment has become a significant issue of common concern to individuals, groups, societies and countries in the world today.

## Open Data

"Open data" refers to a type of electronic data (including but not limited to text, data, pictures, videos, sounds, etc.) that is publicly permitted and encouraged to be used by all sectors of society through certain procedures and formats. According to the definition of the Open Knowledge Foundation ([https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/](https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/)), open data must meet the following conditions:

- Open license or status: The content of the open data must be in the public domain and released with an open license without any additional restrictions.
- Access: The content of open data must be freely accessible from the Internet, but under reasonable conditions, access to open data may also allow a one-time fee and allow for conditional incidental terms.
- Machine readability: The content of open data must be easily accessible, processed and modified by computers.
- Open format: The content of open data must be in an available form, which can be accessed using free or open software.

With the prevalence of open trends such as open source code, open government, and open science, open data has gradually become a standard that governments and scientific communities follow when engaging in various policy advocacy and academic research. The recently booming environment-aware IoT has become one of the most anticipated open data projects due to its widespread distribution in the public domain and its observed environmental information being closely related to the public.

At present, most of the common open data on the Internet use data formats such as JSON, CSV or XML. The full name of JSON format is Javascript Object Notation, which is a lightweight structured data exchange standard. Its content consists of properties and values, which is easy for computers or users to read and use, and is often used for data presentation, transmission and storage on the website.

The full name of the CSV format is Comma-Separated Values. As the name suggests, it is a form of storing table data in plain text, where each data is a column and each attribute in the data is a column. All properties must be stored as plain text in a specific order, with a specific symbol to separate different properties. Commonly used for file import and export of applications, network data transmission, historical data storage, etc.

The full name of the XML format is Extensible Markup Language, which is an extensible markup language simplified from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), allowing users to define the required tags. It is often used for the presentation of document file data and the exchange of network data in order to create documents containing structured information.

Currently, open data commonly used in Taiwan are aggregated on the following platforms:

- Taiwan government open data platform ([https://data.gov.tw/en/](https://data.gov.tw/en/))
- Taiwan open weather data ([https://opendata.cwb.gov.tw/devManual/insrtuction](https://opendata.cwb.gov.tw/devManual/insrtuction))
- Taiwan EPA open data platform ([https://data.epa.gov.tw/en](https://data.epa.gov.tw/en))

## Civil IoT Taiwan

The “Civil IoT Taiwan” project is developed to address the four urgent needs of the public in order to integrate and close to the public services related to people’s livelihood, including air quality, earthquake, water resources, disaster prevention and other issues. In the “Digital Technology” section of the “Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program” project, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Academia Sinica, and the Council of Agriculture have jointly constructed a large-scale inter-ministerial government project, which applies big data, artificial intelligence, and Internet of things technologies to build various smart life service systems to help the government and the public face the challenges brought about by environmental changes. At the same time, this project also considers the experience of different end-users, including government decision-making units, academia, industry, and the general public. The goal is to enhance intelligent governance, assist the development of industry/academia, and improve the happiness of the public.

At present, the four major areas covered by the Civil IoT Taiwan project are:

- Water resources: The Civil IoT Taiwan project cooperates with the water conservancy units of the central and local governments to develop and deploy various water resource sensors and build various hydrological observation facilities and farmland irrigation water sensors. The goal of this project is 1) to effectively integrate surface, groundwater, emerging water source information, and related monitoring information; 2) to establish a water resource IoT portal and dynamic analysis and management platform for irrigation water distribution to strengthen the flood control operation system of each river bureau; 3) to establish the sewer cloud management platform that can perform remote, automated and intelligent management for relevant units at all levels; and 4) to achieve the goal of combined use and promote various applications such as intelligent control and management of water sources, dynamic analysis and management of irrigation water distribution, value-added applications of sewage and sewer, and road flood warning. The opening of data will promote the development of water resources data applications and public-private partnership decision-making.
- Air quality: The Civil IoT Taiwan project, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and Academia Sinica, started with the deployment of air quality sensing infrastructure, developed air quality sensors, and established a sensor performance testing and verification center. And many air quality sensors for different purposes are widely distributed throughout Taiwan. This project launches a computing operation platform for the Internet of Things and an intelligent environment sensing data center by collecting a large amount of sensing data at shorter time and space scales. It builds a visualization platform for air quality sensing data. On the one hand, it promotes the development of the Internet of Things for air quality sensing. On the other hand, it provides high-resolution evidence data for intelligent environmental protection inspections to identify polluted hot spots and effectively conduct environmental governance. At the same time, the project also strengthens the research and development capacity of its domestic technology during the plan period. It establishes the development of domestic, independent airborne product sensing technology.
- Earthquakes: The Civil IoT Taiwan project also significantly increases the number of on-site earthquake quick-reporting stations to provide high-density, high-quality earthquake quick-reporting information for everyday seismic activity in Taiwan. At the same time, seismic and geophysical observatories were added and upgraded to improve the quality and resolution of observational data, including Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, underground seismic stations, strong earthquake stations, geomagnetic stations, and groundwater stations. In addition, the project is enhancing its GNSS stations, underground seismic stations, and drone observations for regional monitoring of the Datun Volcano. Given Taiwan's unique island characteristics, it has strengthened its forecasting capabilities for solid earthquakes and tsunamis and expanded submarine optical cables and related sub and land stations. In addition, the project has constructed an integrated data management system for Taiwan's seismic and geophysical data through the integration and application of big data. The system can facilitate the integration of local and regional earthquake quick report information, strengthen the monitoring of Taiwan's fault areas and the Datun volcanic area, and provide fast and complete earthquake rapid report information transmission, thereby providing the public with real-time early warning of strong earthquakes and promoting the development of the earthquake disaster prevention industry.
- Disaster prevention and relief: The Civil IoT Taiwan project gathers 58 types of warning data covering air, water, land, disaster, and people's livelihood into a single "Civil Alert Information Platform" to provide the public with real-time disaster prevention and relief information. Moreover, incorporating the emergency management information cloud system (EMIC2.0) and other decision-making assisting systems, the platform provides disaster prevention personnel with various disaster situations, notifications, and disaster relief resources to help in multiple decision-making work. At the same time, the relevant historical data is collected and released in a unified data format, which is made available for the disaster prevention industry to analyze, use, and promote the development of the disaster information industry chain.

## Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform

In addition, the Civil IoT Taiwan project also plans the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform to accommodate various data generated by the Civil IoT Taiwan project and provide stable and high-quality sensing data for various environmental management purposes. In the spirit of open data, the platform adopts a unified data format, offers real-time data interfaces and historical data query services, improves user browsing and search speed, and sets up sensor data storage mechanisms to help scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. The data service platform can narrow the gap in environmental information and provide more real-time and comprehensive environmental data, allowing the public to view perception information and temporal and spatial changes in real time and to understand the living environment at any time. The data provided by the platform can also be used as a basis for industrial value-added, thereby stimulating the creativity of the people and providing high-quality services for solving their problems of the people.

Currently, the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform uses the open data format of the [OGC SensorThings API](https://developers.sensorup.com/docs/). Please refer to the following slides and pictures for relevant data format descriptions and data content in various fields:

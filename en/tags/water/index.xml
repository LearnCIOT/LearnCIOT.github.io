      <description>Table Of Contents Intersect Buffer Multi-ring buffer Distance matrix Brief Summary In the past, if we wanted to learn about things like air quality, earthquakes, or floods, we usually depended on information from public sources or experts to understand how widespread and intense these events were.
Imagine you want to check the air quality around your home. The Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network, managed by the Environmental Protection Administration Executive Yuan, is a key source of this info.</description>

      <description>Table Of Contents Voronoi diagram Convex hull Clustering Kernel density Spatial interpolation Inverse Distance Weighting Kriging Nearest neighbor Interpolation Contour Profile References Environmental microsensors scattered throughout our surroundings play a crucial role in gathering information. This data aids us in making informed decisions and taking appropriate actions. A key aspect of this process involves understanding the spatial relationships between sensor stations when analyzing their data. These station locations can reveal geometric patterns or form spatial clusters.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction Table Of Contents Environment Perception Open Data Civil IoT Taiwan Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform References Environment Perception Human beings are full of curiosity about the changes in the natural world, which can probably trace back to the activities of ancient agricultural civilizations, looking up at the stars and stargazing at night. By the Renaissance in the 16th century AD, Copernicus deduced the &amp;ldquo;heliocentric theory&amp;rdquo; based on the existing astronomical data.</description>

      <description>2. Overview of the Materials In this topic, we will introduce the overall structure of the developed materials of Civil IoT Taiwan Open Data, as well as the programming language Python and the development platform Google Colab used in the materials. In addition to conceptual descriptions, we also provide a large number of extended learning resources from shallow to deep, so that interested readers can further explore and learn according to their own needs.</description>

      <description>3. Data Access In this topic, we will describe how to directly access the data of the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform using simple Python syntax through the pyCIOT package. To gain a deeper understanding of the different ways to access data with examples, we divide this topic into two units for a more in-depth introduction:
3.1. Basic Data Access MethodsWe introduce how to obtain water, air, earthquake, and disaster data in the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform, including the latest sensing data for a single site, a list of all sites, and the latest current sensing data for all sites.</description>

      <description>4. Time Series Data Analysis In this topic, we will introduce time series data analysis methods for IoT data. We will develop the following three units for a more in-depth exploration by using the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform.
4.1. Time Series Data ProcessingWe use the sensing data of Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform to guide readers to understand the use of moving average, perform periodic analysis of time series data, and then disassemble the time series data into long-term trends, seasonal changes and residual fluctuations.</description>

      <guid>https://LearnCIOT.github.io/en/ch6/</guid>
      <description>6. Data Applications In this topic, we will focus on derivative applications using Civil IoT Taiwan open data. We strengthen the value and application services of Civil IoT Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s open data by importing other library packages and analysis algorithms. The units we expect to develop include:
6.3. Joint Data CalibrationWe use air quality category data of the Civil IoT Taiwan project to demonstrate the dynamic calibration algorithm for Taiwanese micro air quality sensors and official monitoring stations.</description>

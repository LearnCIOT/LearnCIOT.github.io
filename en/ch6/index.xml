      <description>Table Of Contents Package Installation and Importing Initialization and Data Access Data Preprocessing Calibration Model Establishment and Validation Best Calibration Model of the Day Calibration Results References In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at how air quality data from Civil IoT Taiwan can be used. We&amp;rsquo;ll explain how we can calibrate two types of air quality sensors using data science, so they work together better. This helps us get a more complete picture of air quality.</description>

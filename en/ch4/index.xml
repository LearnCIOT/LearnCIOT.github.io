      <description>Table Of Contents Goal Package Installation and Importing Data Access and Preprocessing Data Clustering Fast Fourier Transform Wavelet Transform References Cluster analysis is a commonly used data processing method in data science, and its primary purpose is to find similar clusters in the data. After cluster analysis, data with similar attributes are clustered together for ease of use, and researchers can perform deeper analysis and processing on data with similar characteristics.</description>

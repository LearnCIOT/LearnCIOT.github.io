      <description>Table Of Contents Goal Package Installation and Importing Data Access and Preprocessing Data Clustering Fast Fourier Transform References Cluster analysis is a popular technique in data science aimed at identifying groups, or &amp;lsquo;clusters&amp;rsquo;, of similar data points. This method helps organize data by grouping similar items together, making it easier for researchers to conduct more detailed analyses on these sets. In the context of Civil IoT Taiwan, where the data from sensors is in the form of time series (data points collected over time), this approach is especially useful.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction Table Of Contents Environment Perception Open Data Civil IoT Taiwan Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform References Environment Perception Human beings are full of curiosity about the changes in the natural world, which can probably trace back to the activities of ancient agricultural civilizations, looking up at the stars and stargazing at night. By the Renaissance in the 16th century AD, Copernicus deduced the &amp;ldquo;heliocentric theory&amp;rdquo; based on the existing astronomical data.</description>

      <description>3. Data Access In this topic, we will describe how to directly access the data of the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform using simple Python syntax through the pyCIOT package. To gain a deeper understanding of the different ways to access data with examples, we divide this topic into two units for a more in-depth introduction:
3.1. Basic Data Access MethodsWe introduce how to obtain water, air, earthquake, and disaster data in the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform, including the latest sensing data for a single site, a list of all sites, and the latest current sensing data for all sites.</description>

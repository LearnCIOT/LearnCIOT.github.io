      <description>Table Of Contents Data access under temporal conditions Data access under spatial conditions Case study: Is the air quality here worse than there? Import data Remove invalid data Calculate distance Pandas package Results References This article will access the data of the Civil IoT Taiwan project from the perspective of time and space, and carry out a simple implementation with the theme of air quality monitoring. It will covers the following topics:</description>

      <description>Table Of Contents Voronoi diagram Convex hull Clustering Kernel density Spatial interpolation Inverse Distance Weighting Kriging Nearest neighbor Interpolation Contour Profile References Microsensors that are widespread in the environment help us obtain environmental information, making decisions and taking actions accordingly. Therefore, it’s fundamental for us to clearly understand the spatial relationships between stations when analyzing data of stations. Apart from that the location of stations itself may form certain geometric structures or spatial clusters, we can also estimate the values where there’s no stations according to the location of stations and their value differences.</description>
